"The Bridge Riddle","You and three friends must cross a rickety bridge at night with one torch. The bridge can only hold two people at a time, and each person walks at different speeds (1, 2, 5, 8 minutes). When two cross together, they move at the slower person's pace. Zombies are chasing you. Can you all cross in 17 minutes?","Send the two fastest (1 & 2 min) first. 1 returns with torch. Send two slowest (5 & 8 min) together. 2 returns with torch. Finally 1 & 2 cross again. Total: 2+1+8+2+2=15 minutes.","Counterintuitive optimal solution - the naive approach (fastest always ferries) fails. Requires working backwards from constraints. Time pressure narrative adds urgency.","Bridge and Torch Problem first recorded in 'Super Strategies For Puzzles and Games' (1981). Related to Alcuin's 9th century river crossing puzzles.","Optimization Under Constraints - minimizing total time with asymmetric transfer costs"
"The Prisoner Hat Riddle","You and 9 others are captured by aliens who test if you're logical. You'll be lined up facing forward, each wearing a black or white hat. Starting from the back, each person must guess their hat color. Anyone who guesses wrong dies. You can strategize beforehand.","The person in back uses parity: counts odd/even black hats visible and says 'black' for odd, 'white' for even. This sacrificial hint lets each subsequent person deduce their own hat by tracking the running parity of what's been said and seen.","Elegant cooperative solution using parity encoding. Demonstrates how one bit of information can cascade to save everyone. The 'sacrifice' element adds emotional weight.","Hat puzzles date to 1961. Related to error-correcting codes (Hamming codes). Classic 'Three Prisoners and Three Hats' variant from earlier logic literature.","Parity Encoding/Error Correction - single bit encodes aggregate information for the group"
"The Green-Eyed Logic Puzzle","100 green-eyed logicians are imprisoned on an island. If anyone discovers they have green eyes, they must leave at dawn. No mirrors, no communication about eye color. A visitor announces: 'At least one of you has green eyes.' How does this help when everyone already knows this?","All 100 leave on the 100th night. The announcement creates 'common knowledge' - not just that someone has green eyes, but that everyone knows that everyone knows... This enables nested induction: if only 1 had green eyes, they'd leave night 1. If 2, they'd reason about the first case and leave night 2. And so on.","Demonstrates the profound difference between mutual knowledge and common knowledge. The 'useless' information paradoxically changes everything. Mind-bending recursion.","Blue Eyes Puzzle popularized by xkcd/Randall Munroe. Based on work by logicians on common knowledge (Aumann, Lewis). Related to 'Muddy Children' puzzle.","Common Knowledge Induction - information that everyone knows becomes actionable only when publicly announced"
"The Three Gods Riddle","Three gods (True, False, Random) answer yes/no questions. True always tells truth, False always lies, Random answers randomly. They respond in their language where 'da' and 'ja' mean yes/no but you don't know which is which. Ask 3 questions to identify all three.","Ask god A: 'If I asked you if B is Random, would you say da?' Use self-referential questions that force True and False to give same answer. This bypasses the da/ja ambiguity and the Random problem by using nested conditionals.","Called 'the hardest logic puzzle ever' by George Boolos. Multiple layers of uncertainty (identity, language, randomness). Elegant that the da/ja problem is surmountable.","Created by Raymond Smullyan, popularized by George Boolos (1996).

Send 2 lions, return 1 lion. Send 2 wildebeest, return lion+wildebeest. Send 2 wildebeest, return 1 lion. Send 2 lions. Never let lions outnumber on either side.","Classic constraint satisfaction with vivid predator-prey stakes. Multiple solutions exist but all require careful state tracking. The 'both banks matter' twist adds complexity.","Direct descendant of Alcuin of York's 'Wolf, Goat, Cabbage' puzzle (c. 800 AD) from Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes. One of the oldest recorded logic puzzles.","State Space Search - navigating valid configurations while avoiding forbidden states on both sides"
"The Frog Riddle","You need antidote from a female frog. Males and females look identical but males croak distinctively. You see one frog in one direction and two frogs in another. From the pair, you hear a male croak. Which direction gives better odds of finding a female?","Go toward the pair (2/3 chance vs 1/2). For the pair, knowing at least one is male, possibilities are: MF, FM, MM. Two of three have a female. The single frog is just 1/2. (Note: This solution is contested by probability theorists)","Introduces conditional probability in an accessible way. The Monty Hall-like counterintuitive result sparks debate. Controversy about whether croaking provides additional information actually enhances engagement.","Variant of the Boy or Girl Paradox. Related to Monty Hall Problem and Bertrand's Box Paradox. TED-Ed's answer is disputed by probability theorists.","Conditional Probability/Bayesian Update - how new information changes probability distributions"
"The Counterfeit Coin Riddle","You have 12 coins, one is counterfeit (either heavier or lighter). Using a balance scale exactly 3 times, identify the fake coin AND whether it's heavier or lighter.","Divide into groups of 4. Weigh 4 vs 4. Based on result, use ternary search logic - each weighing gives 3 possible outcomes, and 3^3=27 > 24 (12 coins x 2 states), so it's solvable. Specific strategy uses elimination and deduction.","Information-theoretically optimal - exactly enough weighings for the information needed. Beautiful connection between measurement limits and solution existence. Feels impossible until you see it.","Classic balance puzzle dating to at least the 1940s. Variants appear in countless puzzle books. Related to information theory work on coding efficiency.","Ternary Search/Information Entropy - maximizing information gain per query (log base 3 analysis)"

"The Pirate Riddle","5 pirates divide 100 gold coins. Pirate A (strongest) proposes, all vote. Majority passes. If rejected, A is thrown overboard and B proposes, etc. Pirates are logical and greedy. What does A propose?","A proposes: A=98, B=0, C=1, D=0, E=1. Solved by backward induction: E would get 100 if alone, so D offers E nothing (D=100,E=0 passes 1-1). C offers E just 1 to beat that. B offers D just 1. A offers C and E just 1 each.","Counterintuitive that the proposer keeps almost everything. Demonstrates backward induction brilliantly. The ruthless rationality is darkly amusing.","The Pirate Game, first analyzed in game theory literature. Ian Stewart wrote about it in Scientific American (1999). Pure backward induction problem.","Backward Induction/Subgame Perfect Equilibrium - reasoning from end states backward through decision trees"
"The Virus Riddle","A prehistoric virus has escaped. You must navigate a grid of rooms to destroy virus samples before vents open. You can only enter an infected room once (you destroy it). Find a path that destroys all infected rooms and reaches the exit.","Map the rooms as a graph. Find a Hamiltonian path through infected rooms. The entrance being uninfected means you can pass through it twice, which enables a solution that wouldn't otherwise exist.","Hamiltonian path disguised as survival horror. The 'uninfected entrance' twist is crucial and easy to miss. Time pressure adds narrative stakes.","Hamiltonian path problem has been studied since 1850s (Icosian game). Connects to traveling salesman problem and graph theory fundamentals.","Graph Traversal - finding Hamiltonian paths with special node properties"
